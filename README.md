# code-editor

## Description

This app is a live code editor in browser, that allows a user to write HTML, CSS and Javascript in three different panels, and to see the output into another. After the user has finished writing code, it can be downloaded as a html file that can be opened in browser. Every panel (for HTML, CSS, Javascript) has its own settings, like theme, font-size, auto close tags, tab dimension and many more. The user can also change the grid view, or resize every tab he desires.

## In the image below, the output is computing the code live, but to run the script, a user has to click on the "Run" button.
